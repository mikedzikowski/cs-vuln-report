### Basic Usage (All Vulnerabilities, All Registries)
```bash
python3 crowdstrike_vuln_analyzer.py
```

### Registry Filtering Options

#### Option 1: Include Only Specific Registries ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**
```python
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = [
    "registry-1.docker.io",  # Docker Hub
    "gcr.io",                # Google Container Registry
    "quay.io",               # Red Hat Quay
    "your-company.registry.com"  # Your private registry
]
EXCLUDE_REGISTRIES = None
```

#### Option 2: Exclude Specific Registries
```python
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = None
EXCLUDE_REGISTRIES = [
    "mcr.microsoft.com",     # Microsoft Container Registry
    "public.ecr.aws",        # AWS Public ECR
    "registry.redhat.io"     # Red Hat Registry
]
```

#### Option 3: All Registries (Default)
```python
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = None
EXCLUDE_REGISTRIES = None
```

### Vulnerability Filtering Options

```python
# Only high and critical vulnerabilities
VULN_FILTERS = "severity:['High','Critical']"

# Only vulnerabilities with CVSS >= 7.0
VULN_FILTERS = "cvss_score:>=7.0"

# Only exploitable vulnerabilities
VULN_FILTERS = "exploit_found:true"

# All vulnerabilities (default)
VULN_FILTERS = None
```

## üìà Data Analysis

### Using Python
```python
import json
import pandas as pd

# Load results
with open('vulnerability_analysis_INCLUDE_REGISTRIES_20250107_173743.json', 'r') as f:
    results = json.load(f)

# Convert to DataFrame for analysis
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Analyze registry-filtered results
registry_filtered = df[df['filtering_method'] == 'include_registries']
print(f"Registry-filtered CVEs: {len(registry_filtered)}")

# Find high-impact vulnerabilities in your registries
high_impact = df[df['image_count'] > 100]
print(f"High impact CVEs in filtered registries: {len(high_impact)}")

# Registry breakdown analysis
for _, row in df.head(10).iterrows():
    if row['registry_breakdown']:
        print(f"{row['cve_id']}: {row['registry_breakdown']}")

# Export to CSV for Excel
df.to_csv('vulnerability_analysis_with_registries.csv', index=False)
```

### Registry-Specific Analysis
```python
# Analyze which registries have the most vulnerabilities
registry_totals = {}
for result in results:
    if result.get('registry_breakdown'):
        for registry, count in result['registry_breakdown'].items():
            if isinstance(count, int):
                registry_totals[registry] = registry_totals.get(registry, 0) + count

print("Images by registry:")
for registry, total in sorted(registry_totals.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
    print(f"  {registry}: {total:,} images")
```

## üîç Registry Discovery

The script includes automatic registry discovery:

```python
# Discovered registries in your environment
available_registries = analyzer.discover_all_registries()
print(f"Found registries: {available_registries}")

# Common registries found in enterprise environments:
# - registry-1.docker.io (Docker Hub)
# - gcr.io (Google Container Registry)
# - quay.io (Red Hat Quay)
# - mcr.microsoft.com (Microsoft Container Registry)
# - public.ecr.aws (AWS Public ECR)
# - ghcr.io (GitHub Container Registry)
# - registry.gitlab.com (GitLab Container Registry)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
```
‚úó Authentication failed: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized
```
**Solution**: Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct and have Container Security: Read permissions.

#### Registry Filtering Not Working
```
‚ùå Registry filtering failed for all registries
```
**Solution**: 
1. Run the registry discovery first to see available registries
2. Use exact registry names from the discovery output
3. Check that registries actually contain vulnerable images

#### No Registries Found
```
‚ùå No registries found - cannot test filtering
```
**Solution**: Your environment might not have container images, or the API permissions might be insufficient.

#### Performance Issues
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Processing taking longer than expected
```
**Solution**: 
- Use `INCLUDE_REGISTRIES` to focus on specific registries
- Add `VULN_FILTERS` to reduce the dataset size
- Consider running during off-peak hours

### Registry Filtering Debug

If registry filtering isn't working, run the debug version:

```python
# Add this to test registry filtering
analyzer.test_registry_filtering_comprehensive()
```

## üìä Performance Guidelines

### Small Environment (< 1K vulnerabilities)
```python
# Default settings work fine
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = None
VULN_FILTERS = None
# Expected runtime: 5-10 minutes
```

### Medium Environment (1K-10K vulnerabilities)
```python
# Consider focusing on important registries
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = ["your-prod-registry.com", "registry-1.docker.io"]
VULN_FILTERS = None
# Expected runtime: 10-30 minutes
```

### Large Environment (10K-50K vulnerabilities)
```python
# Recommended to use filtering
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = ["your-critical-registry.com"]
VULN_FILTERS = "severity:['High','Critical']"
# Expected runtime: 30-120 minutes
```

### Enterprise Environment (50K+ vulnerabilities)
```python
# Aggressive filtering recommended
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = ["production.registry.com"]
VULN_FILTERS = "severity:['Critical']+exploit_found:true"
# Expected runtime: 2-4 hours
```

## üìù API Endpoints Used

1. **OAuth2 Token**: `/oauth2/token`
2. **Vulnerabilities**: `/container-security/combined/vulnerabilities/v1`
3. **Image Aggregation**: `/container-security/aggregates/images/count/v1` ‚úÖ **Registry filtering works here**
4. **Detections** (discovery): `/container-security/combined/detections/v1`

## üîí Security Notes

- Store API credentials securely (consider environment variables)
- The script only requires read permissions
- All API calls use HTTPS
- No sensitive data is logged or stored
- Registry filtering happens server-side (secure)

## üéØ Use Cases

### Security Team Prioritization
```python
# Focus on critical vulnerabilities in production registries
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = ["prod.company.com", "staging.company.com"]
VULN_FILTERS = "severity:['Critical','High']"
```

### Compliance Reporting
```python
# Exclude public registries for internal compliance
EXCLUDE_REGISTRIES = ["docker.io", "registry-1.docker.io", "public.ecr.aws"]
VULN_FILTERS = None
```

### Development Team Focus
```python
# Include only development registries
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = ["dev.company.com", "test.company.com"]
VULN_FILTERS = "remediation_available:true"
```

### Executive Dashboard
```python
# High-level overview of critical issues
INCLUDE_REGISTRIES = None  # All registries
VULN_FILTERS = "severity:['Critical']+exploit_found:true"
```
